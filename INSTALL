Installing Freeciv:
===================

This file gives some basic instruction on how to compile and install 
Freeciv. 

Freeciv requires that the xpm-library is available on your system.
The xpm-library is in wide use, and is properly already installed
on your box. A number of the major X vendors have even started to 
ship with xpm pre-installed. And more important all Linux(yeah!) 
distributions we know of, comes with xpm.
At the bottom is described how you install the xpm-library.


Compiling freeciv
=================
Back to Freeciv. Have a look at the top of the Imakefile. There're a few
parameters which you might want to alter.

When done type 'xmkmf' and then just 'make'.


When it doesn't compile:
========================
If you don't have xmkmf/Imake on your system the use the Makefile.noimake 
file instead.

If the errors are related to the xpm-library, then look in the section below
about xpm.

If the compilations halts due to missing X11 .h or lib files, then it's safe to 
assume that Imake hasn't been installed properly on your system. Consider
using the Makefile.noimake.

Freeciv doesn't work with Xaw3d. So you have to link with the original
Athena widget library.

Ok - it compiled now - install it:
==================================
All Freeciv need is the files civclient, civserver and the files in
the directory data/.

When the client starts, it looks in the current directory for the
data/ directory. You can override this by setting the environment
variable FREECIV_DATADIR to point to another location, like:

setenv FREECIV_DATADIR /usr/games/freeciv/data

However the civ script located in the Freeciv main-directory, sets
the FREECIV_DATADIR to point to DIR/data, where DIR is the directory where 
the script is located, then runs civclient.

Finally, if you're root, you should copy the file data/Freeciv into
your app-defaults directory(properly /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults).

Installing xpm-library
======================

Anyway if you don't have xpm installed then read the following 
instruction:

Fetch the file ftp://koala.inria.fr/pub/xpm/xpm-3.4i.tar.gz
(Or u can fetch the file:  ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries/xpm.11.src.tar.Z)
Untar it and uncompress the file and type the command xmkmf -a.

If you HAVE root permissions, do a make install and you're done.

If you only have normal user permissions, then just type make.
Now the lib directory contains the xpm-library. You can now delete everything
except 'libXpm*' and xpm.h. Next find the xpm related lines in the Imakefile 
and change the xpm paths. There's an example there that shows what to do. 
Finally navigate into the freeciv directory and type the command 'xmkmf'.
Before running you should set the env. variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
point to the directory containg libXpm(at least his goes for Sunos and Linux).
